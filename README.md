## About the project

[(https://spinspinaway.netlify.app)]

My mentor, André Elias *(thank you for the challenge)*, gave me a challenge to create a sphere and a cube side by side using Three.js: a Javascript animation library. Pretty straightforward and simple right? Yes and No.
Anyway, I ended up doing more than what I was challenged to do because Three.js is just that fun! 

*Side note: Thanks to Emilian Kasemi as well, for helping me set up Three.js.*


## What extra thing did I do
- Set up Orbit controls so you can drag, zoom in, zoom out, and rotate the meshes (cube and sphere), as you will
  
- Used MeshNormalMaterial instead of MeshBasicMaterial so I could target wireframes and view the meshes differently. And also because I wanted to play around with what I was learning from the [documentation][(https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)]
  
- Added a nav bar, header, and social icons and used GSAP timeline to animate them as well as the meshes

## Developer's Log
- For a first project, I would say I did a lot of research than I thought I would and fixed more bugs than I have ever in my entire programming *PS. I still have another bug to fix haha*. But hey, that's what makes this fun rightt??
